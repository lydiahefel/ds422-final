# Octocoral in Hawaiʻi
**DS422 Geocomputation | Final Project

## Project Summary
After learning about the threat of "octocoral" on the coral reef ecosystem of Hawaiʻi, we wanted to see what coral reef data was available for Hawaiʻi. We found data from *NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration* that focused primarily on *Deep Sea Corals and Sponges* throughout the Hawaiian islands.
