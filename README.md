# Octocorallia in Hawaiʻi
**DS422 Geocomputation | Final Project**

## Project Summary
After learning about the threat of octocorallia, commonly known as octocoral, on the coral reef ecosystem of Hawaiʻi, we wanted to see what coral reef data was available for Hawaiʻi. We found data from *NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration* that focused primarily on *Deep Sea Corals and Sponges* with location options throughout the Hawaiian islands. The Navy has been preparing to remove invasive coral from Pearl Harbor, having detected octocoral in the harbor since 2020. However, the NOAA data suggests that octocoral has been found throughout the Hawaiian islands since 1967. Our project aims to analyze the spread of octocoral throughout Hawaiʻi.

## Data
As mentioned, the data used for our data visualizations and analysis was accessed via: [NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration | Deep Sea Corals and Sponges](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/deep-sea-corals-portal/?page=Page&views=Summary)
